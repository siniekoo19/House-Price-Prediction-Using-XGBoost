A machine learning model to predict home prices using the XGBoost algorithm. The goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate the market value of residential properties based on various features such as location, size, no. of beadrooms etc and market trends.

 ## Webapp
 [house-price-prediction-webapp](https://house-price-prediction-using-xgboost-webapp.streamlit.app/)


## Project Structure
The project consists of two main folders:

- `Home_Price_Prediction.py:` This file contains the code for building the machine learning model.
- `app.py:` This file hosts the Streamlit application for predicting home prices.

### Process:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** 
- The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accurate predictions can be made.
- Tasks include handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

2. **Model Building:** 
- The XGBoost model is built using the preprocessed data.
- This involves training the model on historical data and fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

3. **Web Application Development:**
- A Streamlit interface is created to provide a user-friendly web application.
- Users input property details, and the application provides predicted home prices based on the trained model.

4. **Deployment of Web Application:** 
- The Streamlit application is deployed to a web server to make it accessible to users.
- Users can access the application through a web browser to obtain predictions for home prices.
